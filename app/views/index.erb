              This was a story of Larry the lobster. Living in the depths of the ocean, Larry and his parents happily rested on the ocean floor. However, Larry was always lonely and depressed that he didn't have a brother or sister to play with. 
              One day, as the lobsters were relaxing in the sand, Larry's parents were violently snatched up in a lobster trap. Feeling crushed, Larry decided to go into the lobster trap and save them. Despite his great efforts to save his parents, he found them to be lifeless and dead. Exausted and weeping, he sat in the cage as it was raised to the ocean's surface.
              Suddenly, Larry woke in midsts of the kitchen. Dead lobsters surrounded him; he was the only one alive. Larry climbed out of the lobster trap, tears streaming down his face. Now he was destined to continue his life for his dead parents. The only way to do this was to escape the kithchen and take revenge on the cook who killed his parents and captured him.
